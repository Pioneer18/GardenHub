### Overview

![alt text](Assets/images)

We used the googleMaps API and the soilGrids API.

Garden hub is targeted towards inexperienced to experienced gardeners who are planning to start a new garden but are not sure
what type of plants (specifically fruits or vegetables) that can be supported by the soil in their area.

The user can either use their immediate location or enter the address of a location that they are interested in starting a garden at. 

once they have choosen a location our application provides a soil overview as well as a breakdown of the corresponidng vegetables and fruits that are most compatible with their soil's properties. The user is also provided with related growing tips for each of the returned vegetables. 

### Additional Information
Soil Grids is a system for automated soil mapping based on global compilation of soil profile data and publicly available remote sensing data.


**Enjoy!**
